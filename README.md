## Title
**Stopwatch made with ReactJS**
## Description
This is a simple stopwatch app with 3 buttons; Start, Stop and Reset. This is one my very first projects which I did in order to learn more about programming in ReactJS. 
## Installation
    npm create-react-app weather-app
    cd weather-app
    npm start
Then just copy this repository and overwrite the files.
## Instructions
This app is fairly easy to use with 3 buttons; Start, Stop and Reset. On pressing Start the timer starts, on pressing Stop the timer pauses and on pressing Reset the timer resets back to zero.
